# Heart stroke prediction

To begin with, we performed data preparation which includes cleaning the data, handling
missing values, dealing with categorical variables, and finally splitting the dataset into training
and testing sets. Our dataset had a fair number of rows and columns with a few missing values.
We then removed the unwanted columns and filled the remaining missing values as a part of data
cleaning. In our dataset the dependent column was the ‘stroke’ which had categorical values ‘0’
and ‘1’.
Next, we performed EDA on the columns that we identified to have a relation and found it best
to visualize them in the form of plots to gain a better understanding of the relationship between
each column.
Later, we performed Hypothesis Testing using T-test and One-way Anova for which we
analyzed the dataset and made our assumptions of what the null and alternate hypothesis were.
Finally, we split our data to train and test and used different techniques to find which model fits
well for our prediction and also noticed the change in accuracy score.
